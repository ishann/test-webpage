I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Dozee](https://www.dozee.health), where I work on data-driven methods for Non-Contact Blood Pressure estimation and earlier worked on Early Warning Systems. I graduated with a [Masters in Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) advised by [Prof. Min Kyung Lee](https://minlee.net). Previously, I graduated with a [Masters in Robotics](https://www.ri.cmu.edu) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) advised by [Prof. Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/). Before starting graduate school, I worked on biometrics at IIIT Delhi and spent four wonderful years at the University of Delhi.

My research experience spans applying Machine Learning to healthcare data (Non-Contact Blood Pressue estimation, Early Warning Systems), computer vision (weakly and webly supervised learning, long-tailed object detection, semantic segmentation, medical imaging, and biometrics) and human-AI interaction (personalized algorithmic management and fair resource allocation). I am interested in the research and development of large-scale AI systems with a focus on personalized Machine Learning.
